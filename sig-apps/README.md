# Apps SIG

Covers deploying and operating applications in Kubernetes. We focus on the developer and devops experience of running applications in Kubernetes. We discuss how to define and run apps in Kubernetes, demo relevant tools and projects, and discuss areas of friction that can lead to suggesting improvements or feature requests.

## Goals
* Discuss running applications in k8s
* Discuss how to define and run apps in k8s (APIs, CLIs, SDKs, package management tools, etc.)
* Suggest k8s features where we see friction
* Be the voice of the people running applications into the k8s development (developers and devops)
* Help people get involved in the kubernetes community
* Show early features/demos of tools that make running apps easier

## Non-goals
* Our job is not to go implement stacks. We're helping people to help themselves. We will help connect people to the right folks * but we do not want to own a set of examples (as a group)
* Do not endorse one particular tool
* Do not pick which apps to run on top of the platform
* Do not recommend one way to do things

## [Helm](https://helm.sh) and [Charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)
