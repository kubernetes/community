## Why me?

When Michelle Noorali nominated me, it took me off guard. I had considered running, but wasn't sure if it was the right place for me to focus my efforts in the community, since I already wear a lot of hats.  As I got more familiar with the specific mission, goals, and responsibilities, I realized that it's a perfect fit for what I do best.  The steering committee represents a unique convergence of my passion for servant leadership, organizational dynamics, inclusion, advocacy, and process optimization. It's always my highest purpose to be a voice and advocate for those I serve.  And, if elected, I will faithfully serve the ever-changing, sometimes divergent, and always important needs of the Kubernetes community.

## Servant leadership

Since my first moments in the community, I have sought out every opportunity I can to make things better.  I wrote an article about this called [What Kubernetes means to me](http://bit.ly/k8s2me) that will shed some light on my journey to this point. My contributions to the community currently include leading the 1.8 release team, co-leading SIG Azure, SIG Architecture, and SIG Cluster Ops (although Rob Hirschfeld has been covering for me while I work on the release).  I have facilitated every release retrospective since 1.3, and have improved my typing skills by note taking at countless SIG meetings.  I also work behind the scenes on Community things with Sarah and Jorge.  

## Career

I've been in love with systems, networks, and the human elements of interconnectivity since I was a SysOp on a BBS as a teenager. My first hack was in grade school, making the Oregon Trail game say naughty things.  In the time since, I have been a systems and network engineer, and held several engineering management directorships at companies large and small.  At Microsoft, all I do is Kubernetes, so I definitely have the organizational support to carry out my duties on the committee.  I write and speak about organizational agility, DevOps, and yep, Kubernetes!  On the side, I live/work on an organic farm, play jazz saxophone, and hand engrave brass musical instruments. 

In closing, I'd like to say there is no losing in this election.  Every person nominated is stellar in their own way.  I am honored to be in such company.
