# About Me

I am a former Sr. Software Engineer at Deis and part of the team that was acquired by Microsoft.
Now, I work on Kubernetes on Azure and have the blessing of Microsoft to continue to do so.

I am a passionate engineer, teacher and leader with over 10 years software engineering and 
architecture experience in a wide variety of fields.

I believe that Kubernetes will truly succeed when we as a community improve the developer and 
user experience. 

# My Experience

I have made contributions to [helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm), [helm charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts), [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), [service-catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and I am a co-lead of SIG-Service-Catalog.

Outside of the Kubernetes world, I have spent over 10 years speaking at a diverse set of 
conferences, teaching Go on a large scale, building large distributed systems with a variety
of technologies, sitting on standards bodies, and contributing code to other open source
communities.

# My Promises

I want to share my promises to the community should I become a member of the commitee. These
are not "campaign promises", but instead intended to reveal my motivations in the community.
I believe in being 100% transparent on what I want to do in the community.

Above everything else, I want Kubernetes to be a nice place to work. And in my experience, 
a "nice place to work" means the following:

- Engineers can build or improve things easily
- Engineers have clear expectations how & (generally) when they will get feedback on their work
- Engineers get constructive feedback on their work
- Everyone is treated with respect, and can resolve interpersonal problems amicably

Holistically, most of these points are true most of the time, but Kubernetes is growing so
fast and is so diverse that all of them are not always guaranteed right now.

_I want to work to change that._ I realize that there is no community in which all of these
points will be true all the time, but I believe we can do better as a group.

Specifically, I want to improve the following immediately:

- Holistically improve user _and_ developer documentation
- Provide better, clearer guidelines on how reviews should happen in all repositories
- Make it clear how to rise as a contributor

Beyond that, I believe that I will generally contribute best to the steering committee as a 
representative of the best interests of end users and developers at large.

I will generally keep the same promises in the steering committee as I do in 
SIG-Service-Catalog: 

- **I will always seek out real user and developer opinions and viewpoints before making decisions**
- **I will always work on user & developer problems before anything else**
