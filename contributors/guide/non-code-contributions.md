# Non-code Contributions

*This section is new and in progress. Expect this document to change often.*

*If you are interested in helping define and structure this work, [check the weekly meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdFWfkrapQclZ4-z4Lx2JwqKsJjXXUOVoLhBzZiZgSk/edit#) for information on how to get involved. You can also find us in the SIG Contributor Experience [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-contribex).*

*All contributors welcome, new and old!*

### What is this?

The list below is meant to help non-code contributors find areas of the Kubernetes project where their expertise can be best utilized. The goal of this is to both provide a starting guide for anyone looking to become a contributor not necessarily writing code, and also to fill any needs that the SIGs have that might not currently be filled by code-focused contributors.

This list is meant to be used by both new contributors looking for a good entrance into the project, and current contributors who would live to do something different.

Are you interested in any of the roles below? Come chat with us [on Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-contribex)!
