# Communication

The Kubernetes community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct].  Here is an excerpt:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._

## SIGs

Kubernetes encompasses many projects, organized into [SIGs](sig-list.md).
Some communication has moved into SIG-specific channels - see
a given SIG subdirectory for details.

Nevertheless, below find a list of many general channels, groups
and meetings devoted to Kubernetes.

## Social Media

* [Twitter]
* [Blog]
* Pose questions and help answer them on [Stack Overflow].
* [Slack] - sign up  

Real time discussion at kubernetes.slack.io:   
Discussions on most channels are archived at [kubernetes.slackarchive.io].
Start archiving by inviting the _slackarchive_ bot to a
channel via `/invite @slackarchive`.
To add new channels, contact one of the admins in the #slack-admins channel. Our guidelines are [here](/communication/slack-guidelines.md).

## Issues

If you have a question about Kubernetes or have a problem using it,
please start with the [troubleshooting guide].

If that doesn't answer your questions, or if you think you found a bug,
please [file an issue].


## Mailing lists

Development announcements and discussions appear on the Google group
[kubernetes-dev] (send mail to `kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com`).

Users trade notes on the Google group
[kubernetes-users] (send mail to `kubernetes-users@googlegroups.com`).

## Office Hours

Office hours are held once a month. Please refer to [this document](events/office-hours.md) to learn more.
