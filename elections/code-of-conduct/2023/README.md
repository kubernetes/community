## Purpose

The role of this election is to fill out the two (2) seats due for
reelection this year on the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee]. Each elected
member will serve a two (2) year term.

## Election Platform

We will be using [Elekto] to conduct the election. Elekto relies entirely on GitHub Oauth for
voting, and as such does not use email at all. Elekto also handles exceptions,
eligibility checks, and other aspects of the election. See the [Elekto voting documentation]
for how to use it.
