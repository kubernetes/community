## Purpose

The role of this election is to fill out the three (3) seats open for election
this year on the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee]. Each elected
member will serve a two (2) year term.

<!-- TODO(cocc): Add blurb about election timing -->

## Election Platform

We will be using [Elekto] to conduct the election. Elekto relies entirely on GitHub Oauth for
voting, and as such does not use email at all. Elekto also handles exceptions,
eligibility checks, and other aspects of the election. See the [Elekto voting documentation]
for how to use it.

## Eligibility

- Candidate commits to putting the interests of the community above the interests of their employer for all Code of Conduct Committee activities.
- Is generally a responsible human
- Does not have to be part of the Kubernetes or CNCF community
- Characteristics which would be nice in any nominations:
  - Previous experience on an Ethics Committee or Code of Conduct Committee is appreciated
  - Has demonstrated integrity, professionalism, and positive influence within the community is appreciated
  - Experience with the tools which we use to communicate (Zoom, Slack, GitHub, etc.) within the Kubernetes community is appreciated

Candidate nomination, bio, and election close deadlines will be done using Anywhere on Earth timing, meaning it is still valid to submit new nominations/bios/votes as long as it is still the last day anywhere on the planet (i.e. at the end of that day in UTC-12).
