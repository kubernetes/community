The 1:1 Hour
=======

One mentor. One mentee. One Hour.

In this mentorship opportunity, you'll be paired with someone in the ecosystem that can help drive your upstream Kubernetes experience forward with a quick burst of information. The mentee controls the content that will be served during that hour. This is open for new AND current contributors of all [levels](/community-membership.md).

Activities that you can select from include:
* pair programming
* live code review how-to (for those wishing to be a reviewer or be a better reviewer)
* live docs review how-to
* live code review of a proposed solution you are working on 
* codebase tour of a certain area
* guidance on your contributor path (advice on becoming an approver, etc.)
* AMA session (ask anything!)

We will attempt to match you with the closest mentor of your area of interested or activity.
