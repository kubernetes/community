# Kubernetes Mentoring Programs

This page indexes all of the mentoring initiatives for contributing to the Kubernetes project. For end user mentoring initiatives, check out KubeCon and other CNCF events and programs.

---

We understand that everyone has different learning styles and we want to support
as many of those as possible. Mentoring is vital to the growth of an individual
and organization of every kind. For Kubernetes, the larger the project becomes,
it's necessary to keep a continuous pipeline of quality contributors and we want you to hang around!
