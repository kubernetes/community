## What You'll Gain By Participating:

* A chance to get your PRs reviewed by members of the community
* Peer code review that can help you get more eyes on your code, or learn more
about a part of the Kubernetes code that may have you struggling
* A deeper understanding of the unique role that our contributors occupy in the
Kubernetes ecosystem as a whole
* Practical advice and hands-on tips for how you can get started as a Kubernetes
contributor, become a member, or otherwise contribute to the project

## What’s on-topic:
* How our contributors got started with k8s
* Advice for getting attention on your PR
* GitHub tooling and automation
* Your first commit
* kubernetes/community
* Testing

## What’s off-topic:
* End-user questions (Check out [#office-hours] on Slack and details [here])

## Submitting questions and/or code for review/walk through:
### Questions:
* Day of on Twitter - use the hashtag [#k8smoc] after your question   
* Slack - Ask your question in #meet-our-contributors

Questions will be on a first-come, first-served basis. The first half of the
discussion will be dedicated to questions for contributors and in the second
half, we will pick a problem (in advance) for peer code review.

### Code snip / PR for peer code review / Suggestion for part of codebase walk
through:
* At least 24 hours before the session to Slack channel (#meet-our-contributors)

Problems will be chosen based on time commitment needed, the skills of the reviewer,
and if a large amount are submitted, need for the project.

## Call for Mentor Panelists!

Expectations of mentors:
* Be online 5 minutes early. You can look at questions in the queue by joining
the #meet-our-contributors Slack channel to give yourself some time to prepare.
* Expect questions about the contribution process, membership, navigating the
Kubernetes seas, testing, and general questions about you and your path to open
source/Kubernetes. It's okay if you don't know the answer!
* We will be using video chat (Zoom, but livestreaming through YouTube) but
voice-only is fine if you are more comfortable with that.
* Be willing to provide suggestions and feedback to make this process & experience
better!
