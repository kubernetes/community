# Contributor Workshop

## Overview 

The Contributor Workshop is a self paced course on the contributor site, aimed at both new and existing contributors.

Previously this workshop was run as a live in person session, as part of the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. With many changes brought upon in 2020, we decided to change the format to a self paced course.

## Status

The Contributor Workshop is currently in development, and has not been released to the public.

You can view the live state of the site by going to [https://workshop--kubernetes-contributor.netlify.app/docs/workshop/](https://workshop--kubernetes-contributor.netlify.app/docs/workshop/)
