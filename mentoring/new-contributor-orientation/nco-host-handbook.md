## Host Responsibilities

Any active contributor with [org membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#member) is invited to participate in New Contributor Orientation (NCO) meetings as a host. A host is an active contributor who participates in NCO by helping to answer attendee questions about contribution based on that host's own unique experience contributing to the project.

The goal of the New Contributor Orientation meeting is to help prospective new contributors find their way in the Kubernetes community by providing them with basic information about the community to help orient them within it, and to provide some mentorship through Q&A with existing contributors. Hosts should keep the audience in mind, and gear their answers to help the attendees find their own path in the community.

Hosts should be cautious not to monopolize the conversation with their own contributor stories, but to instead make room for attendees to share their own goals & ask their own questions. Hosts should provide advice to the specific attendees present as much as possible, rather than to an idea of a generic prospective contributor. Of course in large meetings, and in cases where attendees are overwhelmed, giving specific advice may not be possible, and hosts may need to generalize their advice.
