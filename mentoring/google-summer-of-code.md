## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
Please see [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/) for more details.

## What are SIGs?

Kubernetes is a set of projects, each shepherded by a special interest group (SIG).
To get a grasp of the projects that we work on, check out the complete [list of SIGs](/sig-list.md).

This [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JqcALpsg07eH665ZXQrIvOcin6SzzsIUjMRRVivrZMg) provides an overview of how the Kubernetes community is organized.

## Communication

- Mailing List: development announcements and discussions appear on the Google group `kubernetes-dev` (send mail to kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com).
- Slack: Please [sign up](http://slack.k8s.io/) for an invite.

## Contribute

As part of the application process, the Google Summer of Code program recommends that candidates make small contributions to the project they intend to apply for.
