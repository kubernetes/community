# Mentee Guide for Group Mentoring
This doc is a work in progress

## Welcome and Summary
Welcome prospective mentee! This is an experimental group mentoring program where individuals will work self-paced in a semi-structured learning environment over the course of three months. Want to get lgtm rights? Be a decision maker in an OWNERS file? This could be a great way to get the knowledge you need, some accountability to do it, and interact with active contributors who may on the same path as you and our experienced Kubernetes developers. 

During the three month period, you will work on a path to the next level of membership which will take some work along with peers who have the same goal. This cohort will include mentors who are at least the level that you are targeting with ample experience in the project. These mentors will counsel but not provide answers to the problem or the solution itself. Think of them as true pilots of the sea - navigational experts - only to our codebase. At the end of the three month period, with open communication, the decision to accept or not proceed with the advancement should not be a surprise. 

Familiarize yourself with the [community membership requirements doc](/community-membership.md) including the requirements needed for your specific journey. You’ll receive sponsorship from the mentors and other people you've worked on issues/PRs with upon successful completion of the program. 

## Expectations    
* You understand the requirements to become $member_role (ex: member->reviewer) 
* Good standing throughout the program and uphold our code of conduct
* Attend two bi-weekly standups/workshops a month (1 hour each)
* The program is at your pace but these meetings will discuss your wins and blocks
* These meetings will also cover development area topics, suggested activities, and groomed issues
* Be helpful to your peers in the cohort
* Give back and be a mentor in a future cohort
* Mutual respect from mentors and peers who are in the cohort with you

## Development Areas & Activities
These topics will be covered during bi-weekly standups/workshops. The suggested activities will be covered in the mentee's normal day to day. Know something that should be added? Start a convo/add a PR - your comments are appreciated.
