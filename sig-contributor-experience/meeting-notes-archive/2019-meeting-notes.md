            Shanghai:

*   Almost has a schedule 
*   Needs to do social media pushes
*   Blog needs to be approved

            San Diego: 

*   Mondays @ 10am - first meeting this monday
*   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/events-team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/events-team)
*   Team is formed!!
*   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3792](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3792)
*   Review [project board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/1)
*   Open Mic/Discussion
    *   [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
    *   Project-wide Triage Workflow [nikopen] [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3456](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3456) 
*   Why do we need this: Explicitly desired by many SIG Chairs. [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-contribex/BvGmOQ0v5f0](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-contribex/BvGmOQ0v5f0)
*   Triage workflow overview, new automation and labels to help with that. \
needs-triage [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818) \
Label rework | purge ‘triage’ labels [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814)  \
Standardization of project boards **guidelines **and a template project board. \
Each SIG should have their own board, _however_ it should **not **be mandatory. \
Example from SIG-Windows: [https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/8](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/8)
*   Automation on project boards for issues to receive labels automatically while shifting through columns & shift columns automatically while changing labels on issue directly. \
As per [Hamel Husain](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3672#issuecomment-496672458 ) from Github this is easily achievable and they’re happy to help - it just needs to be hosted somewhere. \
Any leads on hosting a bot like this?
*   Milestone-specific improvements: \
1. SIGs themselves should be deciding on what Enhancements and Bugfixes they are able to handle on an upcoming release beforehand. They should be able to determine their current workforce and schedule on a proactive basis. \
2. Auto-apply current milestone on a merged PR. This is almost ready as a GitHub Action and as a Prow Plugin: [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/11611](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/11611) \
[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12968](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12968)
*   Documentation: Given consensus is reached and changes are implemented, old documents such as [issue-triage.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md ) should be updated to reflect the current state of world. \
Docs should be short, concise and presented as guidelines to follow and utilize the mechanisms that are in place for the benefit of everyone.
*   Release team specifics: \
Given all above are implemented, Bug Triage role will be mostly automated and a very few responsibilities could be delegated to another role.  \
A dashboard that combines views of all SIG boards would be ideal to have for a birds-eye view of on-going work status on a given release, but IMO not necessary as Github search / milestones are pretty much ok.
*   Various other improvements listed at the [bottom of first post in umbrella issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3456) , can be looked on at a later time to optimize flows.
*   Proposed Actions: \
1.  Merge needs-triage & label rework \
[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818) \
[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814)  \
Global announcement on new changes, starting on gap period until 1.16 cycle begins \
2. Project board template, automation and renewed docs on triage \
+ announcement \
 \
(A KEP structure has been proposed for all this but not sure about it - it’s meta changes for upstream, not for k8s the product per se.

[convo notes: potentially make scope smaller, 



*   Dawn and I wanna submit a community/contributor-related CFP for kubecon, would it be ok if we all just sync on what people are submitting so we can complement each other’s sessions? (Jorge)

    *   At the scale that k8s uses GitHub, having bots helps us scale and offload some tasks to our bot minions and frees up more time for real work.
    *   GitHub status set to busy is now used by out GitHub bot so that people who are on vacation, away, or otherwise unable to review PRs will not be assigned new PRs. 
    *   We developed a plugin that triggers when someone contributes their first PR to put an extra welcome message with a link to guides and other info to help people make that first contribution. This is now implemented across all k8s repos.
    *   We have 5 orgs, 190 repos, 900+ unique members. K8s repo alone has 1000+ open PRs, 2000+ issues, which is why we need tools / bots to help us scale. 
    *   We collaborate with SIG Testing on our infrastructure / CI tooling. 
*   Mentoring tomorrow!!!

                    *   Need Marketing & Comms lead + Swag lead - reach out to jonas on slack - @jonasrosland 
            *   CNCF event planners are on site in Barcelona
            *   CNCF event staff contact - Deb Giles 
                *   slack: @Deb Giles
                *   email: dgiles@linuxfoundation.org
*   Slack incident follow-up
    *   Sign-ups remain offline
    *   Webhooks and api integrations are offline excluding a very selective few (GitHub)
    *   No confirmation from Slack that they are fixing the notification bug
    *   Reaching out to end-user community to discuss Slack moderation.
        *   Goes beyond contributor experience -> end user, community, consumer experience
        *   Use slack for contributor activity, but not end-user activity
        *   Need more moderators, at least for the duration to help combat possible spam/trolls
        *   Need at least 3 moderators online around the clock
        *   CNCF will provide 1 additional moderator, but are the stance that it should be handled by the community
    *   Many more communities in kubernetes slack beyond “just” kubernetes e.g. Helm and other projects.
    *   Need to do a risk assessment of Slack itself and what is reasonable response/level of moderation.
        *   Group that did the initial attack has a pattern history of repeatedly going after the same channels and groups.
        *   Is the risk tolerable to keep things open.
        *   Need to protect our user-base from potential harassment
            *   Repeated targeted harassment completely negates the trust for the community. 
    *   Moderation Tools
        *   Slack doesn’t support an IRC Channel Moderator role
        *   Could build something; don’t have resources
        *   Sign-ups
            *   block certain known “bad” domains and gateways (done)
                *   Block list deployed to other slacks has been effective “so far”
            *   Moderation: what questions would we ask people to prove they’re legit?  Easier for developer/community than end user/consumer?
        *   Restrict users from joining specific channels e.g. restrict to #kubernetes-users
            *   [single channel guests](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202518103-Multi-Channel-and-Single-Channel-Guests)
        *   Discuss (discourse) has significantly better moderation tools
        *   What are Slack’s permissions for moderators?  Moderator gets a lot of access/power on the Slack instance.  Real risk in having a bad moderator.  Today though they have to be a community member.  Risk of their login being stolen.
        *   CNCF can potentially fund the development of tools, but it’d be contract work and would require being very spec’ed out.
    *   Plan: 
        *   Bring up end user group and user representation with SC
        *   Reach out to end user community and ToC to get more moderators (currently restricted to org members)
        *   Open up registration once we have enough moderators to cover all timezones etc
        *   If it continues to be a problem, slack moves to contributor only and end-users are routed to discuss.
*   Open discussion:
    *   contribex F2F: KubeCon Barcelona
    *   Mailing List Moderation Changes: 
        *   Google group changes going through in May will remove new user moderation queue. Moderation will be either ON or OFF.
        *   Paris investigating options internally at Google.

            *   At same time porn started coming in too
            *   #kubernetes-users, #helm, and multiple major open source communities were targeted, probably because they have large number of users.
            *   Paris removed the person and pinged our moderators/admins for additional help
            *   More griefers/bots arrived, bigger problem than typical small scale maliciousness
            *   Set of admin’s worked to contain

			Barcelona:



            *   Getting attendance numbers this week
            *   Venue was really good for content 
            *   Retro is tomorrow 
            *   Deb Giles was a great help

            Shanghai:

*   Almost has a schedule 
*   Needs to do social media pushes
*   Blog needs to be approved

            San Diego: 

*   Mondays @ 10am - first meeting this monday
*   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/events-team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/events-team)
*   Team is formed!!
*   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3792](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3792)
*   Review [project board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/1)
*   Open Mic/Discussion
    *   [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
    *   Project-wide Triage Workflow [nikopen] [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3456](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3456) 
*   Why do we need this: Explicitly desired by many SIG Chairs. [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-contribex/BvGmOQ0v5f0](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-contribex/BvGmOQ0v5f0)
*   Triage workflow overview, new automation and labels to help with that. \
needs-triage [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818) \
Label rework | purge ‘triage’ labels [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814)  \
Standardization of project boards **guidelines **and a template project board. \
Each SIG should have their own board, _however_ it should **not **be mandatory. \
Example from SIG-Windows: [https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/8](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/8)
*   Automation on project boards for issues to receive labels automatically while shifting through columns & shift columns automatically while changing labels on issue directly. \
As per [Hamel Husain](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3672#issuecomment-496672458 ) from Github this is easily achievable and they’re happy to help - it just needs to be hosted somewhere. \
Any leads on hosting a bot like this?
*   Milestone-specific improvements: \
1. SIGs themselves should be deciding on what Enhancements and Bugfixes they are able to handle on an upcoming release beforehand. They should be able to determine their current workforce and schedule on a proactive basis. \
2. Auto-apply current milestone on a merged PR. This is almost ready as a GitHub Action and as a Prow Plugin: [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/11611](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/11611) \
[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12968](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12968)
*   Documentation: Given consensus is reached and changes are implemented, old documents such as [issue-triage.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md ) should be updated to reflect the current state of world. \
Docs should be short, concise and presented as guidelines to follow and utilize the mechanisms that are in place for the benefit of everyone.
*   Release team specifics: \
Given all above are implemented, Bug Triage role will be mostly automated and a very few responsibilities could be delegated to another role.  \
A dashboard that combines views of all SIG boards would be ideal to have for a birds-eye view of on-going work status on a given release, but IMO not necessary as Github search / milestones are pretty much ok.
*   Various other improvements listed at the [bottom of first post in umbrella issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3456) , can be looked on at a later time to optimize flows.
*   Proposed Actions: \
1.  Merge needs-triage & label rework \
[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11818) \
[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12814)  \
Global announcement on new changes, starting on gap period until 1.16 cycle begins \
2. Project board template, automation and renewed docs on triage \
+ announcement \
 \
(A KEP structure has been proposed for all this but not sure about it - it’s meta changes for upstream, not for k8s the product per se.

[convo notes: potentially make scope smaller, 



*   Dawn and I wanna submit a community/contributor-related CFP for kubecon, would it be ok if we all just sync on what people are submitting so we can complement each other’s sessions? (Jorge)

*   GitHub Bots:
    *   At the scale that k8s uses GitHub, having bots helps us scale and offload some tasks to our bot minions and frees up more time for real work.
    *   GitHub status set to busy is now used by out GitHub bot so that people who are on vacation, away, or otherwise unable to review PRs will not be assigned new PRs. 
    *   We developed a plugin that triggers when someone contributes their first PR to put an extra welcome message with a link to guides and other info to help people make that first contribution. This is now implemented across all k8s repos.
    *   We have 5 orgs, 190 repos, 900+ unique members. K8s repo alone has 1000+ open PRs, 2000+ issues, which is why we need tools / bots to help us scale. 
    *   We collaborate with SIG Testing on our infrastructure / CI tooling. 
*   Mentoring tomorrow!!!

                    *   Need Marketing & Comms lead + Swag lead - reach out to jonas on slack - @jonasrosland 
            *   CNCF event planners are on site in Barcelona
            *   CNCF event staff contact - Deb Giles 
                *   slack: @Deb Giles
                *   email: dgiles@linuxfoundation.org
*   Slack incident follow-up
    *   Sign-ups remain offline
    *   Webhooks and api integrations are offline excluding a very selective few (GitHub)
    *   No confirmation from Slack that they are fixing the notification bug
    *   Reaching out to end-user community to discuss Slack moderation.
        *   Goes beyond contributor experience -> end user, community, consumer experience
        *   Use slack for contributor activity, but not end-user activity
        *   Need more moderators, at least for the duration to help combat possible spam/trolls
        *   Need at least 3 moderators online around the clock
        *   CNCF will provide 1 additional moderator, but are the stance that it should be handled by the community
    *   Many more communities in kubernetes slack beyond “just” kubernetes e.g. Helm and other projects.
    *   Need to do a risk assessment of Slack itself and what is reasonable response/level of moderation.
        *   Group that did the initial attack has a pattern history of repeatedly going after the same channels and groups.
        *   Is the risk tolerable to keep things open.
        *   Need to protect our user-base from potential harassment
            *   Repeated targeted harassment completely negates the trust for the community. 
    *   Moderation Tools
        *   Slack doesn’t support an IRC Channel Moderator role
        *   Could build something; don’t have resources
        *   Sign-ups
            *   block certain known “bad” domains and gateways (done)
                *   Block list deployed to other slacks has been effective “so far”
            *   Moderation: what questions would we ask people to prove they’re legit?  Easier for developer/community than end user/consumer?
        *   Restrict users from joining specific channels e.g. restrict to #kubernetes-users
            *   [single channel guests](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202518103-Multi-Channel-and-Single-Channel-Guests)
        *   Discuss (discourse) has significantly better moderation tools
        *   What are Slack’s permissions for moderators?  Moderator gets a lot of access/power on the Slack instance.  Real risk in having a bad moderator.  Today though they have to be a community member.  Risk of their login being stolen.
        *   CNCF can potentially fund the development of tools, but it’d be contract work and would require being very spec’ed out.
    *   Plan: 
        *   Bring up end user group and user representation with SC
        *   Reach out to end user community and ToC to get more moderators (currently restricted to org members)
        *   Open up registration once we have enough moderators to cover all timezones etc
        *   If it continues to be a problem, slack moves to contributor only and end-users are routed to discuss.
*   Open discussion:
    *   contribex F2F: KubeCon Barcelona
    *   Mailing List Moderation Changes: 
        *   Google group changes going through in May will remove new user moderation queue. Moderation will be either ON or OFF.
        *   Paris investigating options internally at Google.

            *   Paris ping’d the person to check why they were @’ing channel
            *   At same time porn started coming in too
            *   #kubernetes-users, #helm, and multiple major open source communities were targeted, probably because they have large number of users.
            *   Paris removed the person and pinged our moderators/admins for additional help
            *   More griefers/bots arrived, bigger problem than typical small scale maliciousness
            *   Set of admin’s worked to contain

        *   Dec 10 notify k-dev@ of k/community change [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kubernetes-dev/oWbV6uiQMIM/0ku8cvSZBgAJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kubernetes-dev/oWbV6uiQMIM/0ku8cvSZBgAJ)

        *   **AI: **No documentation on policy for rollback, how fast things should be rolled back etc
        *   This instance was completely unintentional -- no notification / communication sent out
        *   Long term goal to separate the prow codebase from the kubernetes prow configuration.
            *   contribex could become the long term owners of the kubernetes prow config.
            *   Discussion should be taken to the #prow channel.

	



    *   Eduar Tua -  Cleaning the /devel folder
        *   Could we add a line that says `**Owner: SIG-name** `to docs that are not part of a SIG folder?
