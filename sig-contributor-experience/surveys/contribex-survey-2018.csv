I believe this was the intention with the reviewer & approver split, but in my experience this hasn't panned out, and needs more automation to work (see above suggestion about assigning a single reviewer).    Another way to do staged reviews is have reviewers who focus on different aspects, such as: go readability & language idioms, comment language (we have many non-native english speakers), testing, etc. However, I don't want to need 7 different reviewers to sign off on my 10 line PR, so this approach would need more careful consideration.",n/a,Kubecon North America 2017,Kubecon Europe 2018,Kubecon China 2018,Kubecon North America 2018,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Focus more on community & contributor issues.
