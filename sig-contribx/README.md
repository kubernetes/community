# SIG Contributor Experience

We need your help!!!

Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project
and growing the ecosystem. We need to ensure our contributors are happy and productive, we need
to break the [commit-rate ceiling we hit in July 2015](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/graphs/contributors),
and we need to get the monotonically growing PR merge latency and numbers of open PRs and issues under control.

  notifications for important events
* [Too-coarse ACLs](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/1908)
* Inadequate PR reviewer assignment and processes, with too small a reviewer pool
* Lack of a sustainable approach to issue management (we have thousands of open issues, with over 100 new ones each week)
* Lack of processes for growing leadership within the community
* Trying to maintain a [large monorepo in github](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24343), which is intended for small repos and teams
* Insufficient project-wide (cross-SIG) communication and coordination
  * Need to make [slackarchive](http://kubernetes.slackarchive.io/kubernetes-dev) more discoverable
* [Too many flaky tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24753)
* Excessive PR rebases due to checking in generated files
* Inadequate and out-of-date contributor documentation
