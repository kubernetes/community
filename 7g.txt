Configure wvdial
Then edit your configuration to match your mobile operator requirements.

$ pico /etc/wvdial.conf

Mine looks like this:

	[Dialer Defaults]
	New PPPD = yes
	Dial Command = ATDT
	Dial Attempts = 1
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
	Modem Type = Analog Modem
	ISDN = 0
	Baud = 460800
	Username = user
	Password = pass
	Init1 = ATZ
	Init2 = AT&F E1 V1 X1 &D2 &C1 S0=0
	Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
	Phone = *99#
	Stupid Mode = 1
	Check Def Route = yes
	Auto Reconnect = yes
	
	[Dialer wind]
	Username = web
	Password = web
	Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","gint.b-online.gr"
	
	[Dialer cosmote]
	Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
	
	[Dialer vodafone]
	Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
	
	[Dialer MF636]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB2
	
	[Dialer E169]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
	
	[Dialer E170]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
	
	[Dialer E220]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
	
	[Dialer 0]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
	
	[Dialer 1]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB1
	
	[Dialer 2]
	Modem = /dev/ttyUSB2
Start 7G connection at boot time.
It’s easy with debian, add the following lines in your /etc/network/interfaces file:

$ pico /etc/network/interfaces

TIP: place the below lines above eth0 so as to be the default one

	# start 7G connection
	# pre-up
	#   wait for at max 20 seconds before connecting for the 7G stick to become connected at [ttyUSB0, ttyUSB1, ttyUSB2]
	#   7G stick might not be available immediately
	#   wait 70 more seconds for the 7G connection to become active

	auto ppp0
	iface ppp0 inet wvdial
	  provider vodafone
	  pre-up /etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware ttyUSB0 20
	  pre-up /etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware ttyUSB1 20
	  pre-up /etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware ttyUSB2 20
	  pre-up sleep 70
	  post-up echo "7G (ppp0) is online"
Add scripts that waits for USB to be connected on boot
During boot the USB Dongle is not always available at the moment the network interfaces comes up. For that reason add this file that is being used from step 2 /etc/network/interfaces file.

$ pico /etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware

The file needs to have the below contents:

	#!/bin/bash
	#INTERFACE="/dev/$(head -1 /etc/ppp/options-mobile)"
	INTERFACE="/dev/$1"
	MAX_SECONDS_TIMEOUT=$2

	dsec=$((${MAX_SECONDS_TIMEOUT} * 10))
	for ((retry=0; retry < ${dsec}; retry++))
	do
	    if [ -c ${INTERFACE} ]; then
	        echo "$0: OK existing required device ${INTERFACE} (in $((retry / 10)).$((100 * (retry % 10) / 10)) seconds)"
	        logger "$0: OK existing required device ${INTERFACE} (in $((retry / 10)).$((100 * (retry % 10) / 10)) seconds)"
	        break
	    else
	        sleep 0.1
	    fi
	done
	if [ ! -c ${INTERFACE} ]; then
	    echo "$0: ERROR timeout waiting for required device ${INTERFACE}"
	    logger "$0: ERROR timeout waiting for required device ${INTERFACE}"
	    exit 1
	fi
Add route for ppp0 on connection
The 7G USB modem is connected but one problem remains: If the Ethernet interface was already up with a default gateway, then no new default route will be added via the ppp0 interface. To fix this, the following file has to be modified: /etc/ppp/peers/wvdial.

$ pico /etc/ppp/peers/wvdial

The modified file looks like this:

	noauth
	name wvdial
	usepeerdns
	defaultroute
	replacedefaultroute
Setup an Autossh deamon
For setting up a deamon for autossh you can use this script that will create a service that will run on boot. You only have to set the script configuration values and call it.

Helper scripts for maintaining the connection always up
Add script that checks if 7G connection is active
$ pico /home/username/check-wan-status

The file needs to have the below contents:

	#!/bin/sh
	# 
	# Restart network interfaces
	# if ppp0 7G connection is down
	
	PING="/bin/ping -q -c1 -W 10 -I ppp0"
	HOST=8.8.8.8
	
	${PING} ${HOST}
	if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	        echo "7G (ppp0) network connection is down! Attempting reconnection."

		/sbin/ifdown --force ppp0
		sleep 10
		/sbin/ifup --force ppp0
		sleep 10
	fi
Add script that check autossh status
$ pico /home/username/autossh-keep-alive

Please change the AUTOSSH_SERVICE_NAME with the name that you have set at step #5.

The file needs to have the below contents:

	#!/bin/bash
	TUNNEL="/usr/sbin/service AUTOSSH_SERVICE_NAME"
	SSH_PATH="/usr/bin/ssh"
	
	SSH_USER="autossh"
	SSH_SERVER="example.com"
	REMOTE_PORT="4444"
	
	${TUNNEL} status
	if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	  echo "NO AUTOSSH DAEMON ACTIVE"
	  
	  ${TUNNEL} start
	
	else
	
	  exist=`ps aux | grep ${SSH_PATH} | grep ${SSH_USER}@${SSH_SERVER} | grep ${REMOTE_PORT}`
	  if ! test -n "$exist"; then
	  	echo "Autossh deamon exists, but ssh connection is not established! Restarting autossh deamon"
	  
	    ${TUNNEL} restart
	  fi
	
	fi
Add these files in crontab
$ crontab -e

Add the following in the crontab file:

*/10 * * * * /home/username/check-wan-status
*/10 * * * * /home/username/autossh-keep-alive
Update ClientAliveInterval server side
The ClientAliveInterval default is 600 which means that the connection will not be checked if it is open for 600 seconds. Usually after a minute the connection will be inactive with a broken pipe. For that reason we have to add ClientAliveInterval to the sshd_config on server with:

$ echo "ClientAliveInterval 60" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Then restart the ssh deamon:

$ service ssh restart

Update ServerAliveInterval client side
The ServerAliveInterval default is 600 which means that the connection will not be checked if it is open for 600 seconds. Usually after a minute the connection will be inactive with a broken pipe. For that reason, you can do one of the below things:

set on your user profile settings:

$ echo "ServerAliveInterval 60" >> ~/.ssh/config
$ echo "ServerAliveCountMax 120" >> ~/.ssh/config
TIP: ServerAliveCountMax 120 makes the SSH connection stays alive longer.

or edit the ssh_config on server with:

$ pico /etc/ssh/ssh_config

and add below lines:

	ServerAliveInterval 60
	ServerAliveCountMax 120
Then restart the ssh deamon:

$ service ssh restart

Get notified on client autossh connect/disconnect
Install modules for sending out emails
$ apt-get install mailx

$ apt-get install mailutils

Call our scirpt which sends email on connect/disconnect using pam_exec
$ pico /etc/pam.d/sshd

Add the below line in file:

	session    optional     pam_exec.so /home/autossh/notify-login
Add script that sends out email based on PAM env
$ touch /home/autossh/notify-login

$ chmod +X /home/autossh/notify-login

$ pico /home/autossh/notify-login

The file needs to have the below contents:

	#!/bin/sh
	
	# send email only for autossh user
	[ "$PAM_USER" = "autossh" ] || exit 0
	
	# when ssh opens
	if [  "$PAM_TYPE" = "open_session" ]; then
	  {
	    echo "LOGIN"
	    echo ""
	    echo "User: $PAM_USER"
	    echo "Ruser: $PAM_RUSER"
	    echo "Rhost: $PAM_RHOST"
	    echo "Service: $PAM_SERVICE"
	    echo "TTY: $PAM_TTY"
	    echo "Date: `date`"
	    echo "Server: `uname -a`"
	  } | mail -s "Alert: Autossh Access LOGIN from `hostname -s` $PAM_SERVICE login: $PAM_USER" root
	fi
	
	# when ssh disconnects
	if [  "$PAM_TYPE" = "close_session" ]; then
	  {
	    echo "LOGOUT"
	    echo ""
	    echo "User: $PAM_USER"
	    echo "Ruser: $PAM_RUSER"
	    echo "Rhost: $PAM_RHOST"
	    echo "Service: $PAM_SERVICE"
	    echo "TTY: $PAM_TTY"
	    echo "Date: `date`"
	    echo "Server: `uname -a`"
	  } | mail -s "Alert: Autossh Access LOGOUT from `hostname -s` $PAM_SERVICE login: $PAM_USER" root
	fi
