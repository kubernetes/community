# 2018 Kubernetes Contributor Summit EU

## What

The Contributor Summit provides an avenue for Kubernetes contributors to connect face to face and mindshare about future community development and community governance endeavors.

In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

- Cross-SIG communication and announcements
- Grow the number of new developers
- Make existing developers better
