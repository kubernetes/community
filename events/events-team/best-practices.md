## Kickoff
Event lead will start the event strategy doc that will outline goals and content
strategy with content team. This doc should first be circulated within contributor experience for
the [event OWNERs] to review and for the SIG to weigh in. Next, steering committee
and SIG Leads with a comment period. This helps to ensure that we've heard and have
content for most of different types of contributors that we have.

A GitHub repo in the events section will be created to capture history, the team, and other basic information. [(example)] This will not be used as the event website.

## Project Management
Each event will have a [project board] created. The incoming team will need to create a label `area/regionfoo-summit` and any issue or PR related to all summits will have the label `area/contributor-summit`.

The event team can decide if they want a dedicated project manager role at the time of planning.

## Venue
Venue contracts are signed by CNCF  

Conduct venue walk thrus - this is super important to get a feel for the space  
Things to check for:  
Capacity in all rooms, including when stages and AV are present which will cut from chair capacity.  
Signage requirements (what we can and can’t hang/stick to the walls/etc)  
Layout options - some venues have restrictions (example: if there is a birds of a feather, seats should be in a fishbowl for easy conversation vs a lecture)  
AV Options  
Accessibility  

If the event is being held during KubeCon/CloudNativeCon it's important to get a space that is not with other co-located events to avoid confusion like we have had in the past.

## Social / Celebration
The Hallway Track is listed as the favorite track at every event. The social/celebration is a longer hallway track that doesn't interfere with content. The social should have fun activities!  

## Communication and Advertising  
[dev@kubernetes.io][k-dev] is our artery for contributor communication and should be the main news network for contributor events.  
Other channels:  
Slack - [#contributor-summit], [#kubecon], [#kubernetes-contributors]
[Twitter]  
[Kubernetes blog]  
[discuss.kubernetes.io]  

## Sponsorship
We like to keep our events clear from sponsorships as it distracts from the mission.

## Swag / T-Shirts
What messaging do we want to convey with the swag?  
thockin has designed all contributor summit NA shirts and jberkus for Shanghai; both have done an EU shirt  

Best practices:  
Order shirts well in advance before the event to make sure everyone gets the size that they want in case there are custom/shipping issues.  
Past brand that works well: Dakota. Previous brands had odd sizing and community feedback matched that.

## Day of Event Staff
No matter how big the event, there will always be opportunities to help out onsite in some capacity. Here are roles we've recruited for in the past that have been extra helpful:  
Operations lead - helps recruit and train day of staff, charts out their schedules  
Notetakers - some sessions, birds of a feather for example, make for not great recordings because of the constant conversation with multiple people in the room so notetakers help capture action items and other key parts to the meeting.  
Session hosts - Introduces the session/speaker, keeps time, acts as an inclusion advocate to make sure everyone that wants a chance to talk gets one  

## Transparency
All events will be recorded unless otherwise noted. Recordings will be hosted on the Kubernetes Community YouTube channel. Events should try for livestreaming when possible, especially larger events.

## Signage
What signage do we need/content? Design?
Always order twice the signage you think you need. More is always better.
AV options (multiple mics, work with transparency person)
Order AV services

## Contributor Awards  
It's nice to celebrate the hardwork that goes into the community and recognize those doing it.

TODO - codify this, determine what awards, process for nominations, etc.  

## Survey
Questions that we have asked in the past that would be helpful to keep consistent to analyze for trends:
