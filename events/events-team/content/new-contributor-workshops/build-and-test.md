## Build and Test

### Duration

40-60 minutes, depending on beginner vs intermediate participants

### Task Overview

Build Kubernetes binaries locally, and do some fun things with them.

**Important** Have facilitators to help with technical issues (2-3 is enough for Intermediate, you want 5 for Beginner)

### Slides

Clear command line instructions.

### Details To Cover 

- This is the hands-on part. Details are up to you; look to previous workshops for inspiration.
- Adjust difficulty based on whether this is the Beginner or Intermediate workshop.
- It is _extremely important_ to run this part of the workshop several times previously, and to make sure that versions match those in the [workspace setup](./workspace-setup.md).

### Ideas

- Do a fun thing with the go client and a kind cluster
- Build and modify kubectl
- Try a `make` command; be aware you may need to give docker a lot of space on your machine for a successful build.
