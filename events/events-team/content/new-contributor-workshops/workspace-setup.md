## Workspace Setup

### Duration

Plan for 90- 120 minutes of download and setup time when on wifi. When on a workshop specific network, this may be much shortened.

### Task Overview

Make sure all Beginning Contributors have a workspace setup for hacking on Kubernetes.

**Important** Have facilitators to help with technical issues (3-5 for ~30 people)

### Slides

Clear and large download commands to copy into terminal

### Details To Cover 

- Make sure everyone has the correct setup for a local build and test demo.

### Ideas

- Have a dedicated workshop network.
- When internet is slow, start the download and prep process during earlier sessions, to make sure everyone is up to date.
