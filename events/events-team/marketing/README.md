### Communication Channels and Property Access

Communications to the Kubernetes Contributor Community should be sent from
official Kubernetes accounts to ensure they reach the community. Mass messages
from personal accounts can easily wind up being marked as spam. However, in the event 
that you lead Communications and _aren't_ a member of the [SIG ContribEx Contributor Comms team](/communication/contributor-comms/README.md), 
personal email accounts can be used. Please check with the current Event Lead and 
Emeritus Leads on the best course of action.

**Email**

Unless you have access to official Kubernetes accounts, please use your own email account 
to send all email communications. All emails should include summit-team@kubernetes.io in CC each time. 
The Event Lead will add all team leads to this distribution list. 
Outbound communications should always target the main distrubution list, dev@kubernetes.io, as well 
as the co-chairs and tech leads distribution list, leads@kubernetes.io, when necessary.

While it is appreciated that you triage incoming mail for summit-team@kubernetes.io to 
varying team leads, you are not responsible for answering all incoming messages. The entire 
summit planning team should triage and handle their ownership areas when it comes to email communications, 
respectively.

**Website**

The [Contributor Site](https://www.kubernetes.dev/) should be the source of truth for all Contributor Summit information. 
As timing, location, registration, and schedule information is confirmed for the event, the website should be populated 
as soon as possible. The [`OWNERS`](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/blob/master/OWNERS) file defines 
who can approve upstream changes.

All communications via email and social media should link out to the Contributor Site whenever possible. The 
["Events"](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/) top-level page is where all Contributor Summit information is 
organized, by calendar year. 

**Slack**

Slack messaging should be implemented so that all corners of our community are communicated with. Let your emoji power shine! 
The following channels will be important for all major announcements, plus most reminders:
- **#contributor-summit**
- **#kubernetes-org-members**
- **#chairs-and-techleads**

Please contact the [SIG ContribEx Contributor Comms team](/communication/contributor-comms/README.md) for access to the Announcement 
bot in the Kubernetes Slack, which will be useful for broadcasts. The **#contributor-summit** channel should be used for all day-of 
event communications by you and other summit sub-teams. Contributors and attendees will also ask questions here: this channel should 
be monitored up until the day of the summit (the Day-of Ops Team will work with you on communications and monitoring on the 
day of the event).

**X and Mastodon**

Tweets can be sent from two accounts: [@K8sContributors](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors) and [@Kubernetesio](https://twitter.com/kubernetesio). 
Mastodon uses [@K8sContributors](https://hachyderm.io/@K8sContributors) on the hachyderm.io instance. 
Messaging is coordinated via Buffer, which is owned by the [SIG ContribEx Contributor Comms team](/communication/contributor-comms/README.md). 
Please work with the Contributor Comms team for access.

Announcements, live-tweeting, and pictures are all suitable updates for sharing on social media. 
Most emails sent should have this information mirrored on social media, with links out to the 
website for further information.

## Shadow to the Communications Lead Role

This role should include one or more shadows. The Communications Lead should delegate/assign
tasks to the shadows, including the drafting of emails and Slack/social media posts. 
The expectation from a shadow is to lead one of the summit planning team roles in an upcoming summit. 
The shadows to the Communications Lead are responsible for handling all Communications Lead-related 
activities in the absence of the Lead.
