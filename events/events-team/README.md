This page outlines the roles involved with leading contributor events, specifically Kubernetes Contributor Summits. The staff of the event team changes with each event. Events are a subproject of [SIG-Contributor-Experience](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/charter.md).

## Core Events Team roles
Inspired by the [Release Team]

The Event Lead(s) is responsible for determining which core roles need to be filled at the start
of planning for each event. After initial core team meetings, each lead will determine
how to best staff for that function and fill in other roles. Each role will ideally have a shadow for succession planning. Those who have been a part of a previous event get first dibs on lead roles to maintain consistency.

CNCF will provide an events manager dedicated to each summit that will help us put
the logistical and operational pieces together.
