## Election Announcement

It’s that time of year again!

As is now customary, this fall is election season for Kubernetes. Four(4) elected members (cblecker, derekwaynecarr, nikhita, parispittman) will stay on for the remaining year of their terms, and there will be three(3) positions open for election. Every election term will be 2 years. We will be posting regular updates to kubernetes-dev with deadlines and instructions as well as providing quick updates during the regular Thursday community meetings until completion of the election. 

If you’d like to vote or run for a seat, all details and next steps are outlined in the election process doc[3] and voters guide.[4] The voters guide will be the single source of truth of information for this cycle. It will be updated live as new bios of candidates flow through over the next four weeks. Please pay attention to the scheduled dates:

| schedule here | 

As mentioned in the process doc, eligibility for voting will be determined by 50 contributions to a Kubernetes project over the past year, which will result in you getting a ballot emailed to you when the election starts. For those of you doing work within the Kubernetes project / community that is NOT measured in GitHub, you can apply for participation via the voter exemption form. This is to ensure that non-code contributors can participate, so please don’t hesitate to use the form.

## Election Results

This mail only goes to the incumbent members of steering who are NOT running that year!

$greeting,

Please keep this information private! 

An incumbent steering member announces the results. At least one of you please come to the community meeting tomorrow to make the announcement. Let us know if you cannot.

After the community meeting, we'll publish this blog post (feedback encouraged).

A note on the results, as per previous elections we plan on announcing/celebrating the winners and only publishing their names, GitHub handles, and affiliations. We purposely don't mention rankings or the results of the rest of the field. 

We will quietly check in the full election results (with anonymized ballots) into the community repo in the next few weeks. This will satisfy transparency requirements while being respectful to the other candidates. 

Results and data from the 2019 Steering Committee election:

- 879 eligible voters as determined by:
- 864 with 50+ DevStats recorded contributions between 2018-08-15 and 2019-08-15.
- Of the 864, no email address could be determined for 27 of them.
- 15 exception voters.

Emails were obtained from the CNCF's gitdm along with some manual reconciliation and comparison with the kubernetes-dev mailing list.

377 total votes cast as of the close on October 2rd at 5pm PT (43%)

Last Year's data: 700 eligible voters with 307 votes cast (44%)
