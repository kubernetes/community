## SIGS

- SIG Release
  - Tech Lead
  - Release Teams (1.12, 1.17-1.20, 1.23)
- SIG Architecture (Enhancements Sub-project owner)
- SIG CLI

## What I have done

I have been involved in the community since 2017, initially as an end user and then as a member of [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog). I then joined SIG Release, working on a number of Release Teams, eventually becoming Release Lead for 1.20 and now a tech lead. 

As release lead, I focused on improving processes and facilitating a more inclusive culture by [requiring unconscious bias training for release leads](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1251), implementing more asynchronous communication, and driving the creation of meetings in APAC/EMEA friendly times. Since then, I continue to focus on release team improvements and have worked across SIGs to build consensus and drive the adoption of [a release cadence change](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2567).

I also serve my local community, most recently by becoming a member of the board of directors for a local charter school.

## What I'll do

I have seen first hand the impact burnout can have on projects, especially after almost two years of global pandemic. I believe it is important to address contributor burnout and to support SIG leadership as they identify future leads, in order to support sustained health of the project and community. As a member of the Steering Committee, I will actively work to promote inclusion, support contributors and focus on sustainability of the project. As a Steering Committee member, I will also model transparency, and ensure that open communication happens within the project. I will bring my experience as a contributor and as an end user to build consensus and to make balanced decisions.
