## What I have done

As a long-time member of the Kubernetes community, I have served in many capacities. I started as an end-user then progressed to becoming an active community member. I have witnessed the positive impact the Steering Committee has had on the community over the years and would like to continue to build on that legacy. I served as a member of the Steering Committee for 6 months in 2020 where I worked hard to support the community navigate the challenges of that difficult time by aiding in swift decision making to build and maintain a safe and inclusive community. I would be honored to have the opportunity to serve the community in this capacity. 

## What I'll do

I am passionate about building the supporting structures to help scale contributions whilst actively focusing on intervening in processes that lead to contributor burnout. My experience working in open source over the years provide me with well rounded context in which to make effective decisions. I hope that by serving on the Steering Committee, I can help continue to build a safe, supportive, inclusive and collaborative environment for the project to flourish.
