## What I have done

I've started helping to implement IPv6 in Kubernetes in my spare time, and from that
time, I've joined the KIND project and become a member of SIG Testing and SIG Network.

I've done significant contributions to the project, some of the most important are the IPv6
and DualStack features, all the work in CI stabilization and test "flakes", and this little
gem that is the KIND project.

I try to help wherever I'm needed, with special focus on helping users and new contributors,
and keeping the stability and quality bar of the project high.

## What I'll do

Open source projects are complex, they live in ecosystems that evolve at a fast pace and with
multiple stakeholders, contributors, users, companies, ... with different needs and requirements.
I'll help with my experience in Open Source and managing large projects, to keep the balance and
the harmony of the project.

Kubernetes is a big and disruptive Open Source project with more than 6 years of life, I think that
it is still in a young age and I'll work to keep it growing, evolving and being a referent.
