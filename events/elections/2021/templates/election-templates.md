## Election Announcement

It’s that time of year again!

It's also new!  This is the first year we will be using Elekto[0] for the Kubernetes Steering elections.  Elekto was commissioned as an internship project for us by the CNCF.  You'll find it has a much more modern UI, and does not rely on email at all to enable voting.

As is now customary, this fall is election season for Kubernetes. Three(3) elected members (bobkillen, dims, liggitt) will stay on for the remaining year of their terms, and there will be four(4) positions open for election. Every election term will be 2 years. We will be posting regular updates to kubernetes-dev with deadlines and instructions as well as providing quick updates during the regular Thursday community meetings until completion of the election.

If you’d like to vote or run for a seat, all details and next steps are outlined in the election process doc[3] and the Elekto application[7]. The application will be the single source of truth of information for this cycle. It will be updated live as new bios of candidates flow through. Please pay attention to the scheduled dates:

| Start Date | End Date | Activity |
| ---------- | -------- | -----------------|
| 2021-09-21 | 2021-10-07 | Nominate Candidates |
| 2021-09-21 | 2021-10-24 | Request voter exceptions |
| 2021-10-09 | 2021-10-28 | Vote |

As mentioned in the process doc, eligibility for voting will be determined by 50 contributions to a Kubernetes project over the past year and Kubernetes Org membership[5].  Eligible voters will be shown as such when by the Elekto application[7].  If you should be eligible, but are not, you may also file for an exception through the same application. For those of you doing work within the Kubernetes project/community that is NOT measured in GitHub, or if you have 50 contributions but not Org Membership, you can apply for participation via the voter exception form[7] in the Elekto app. This is to ensure that non-code contributors can participate, so please don’t hesitate to use the form.

## Election Results

This mail only goes to the incumbent members of steering who are NOT running that year!

$greeting,

Please keep this information private!

An incumbent steering member announces the results. At least one of you please come to the community meeting tomorrow to make the announcement. Let us know if you cannot.

After the community meeting, we'll publish this blog post (feedback encouraged).

A note on the results, as per previous elections we plan on announcing/celebrating the winners and only publishing their names, GitHub handles, and affiliations. We purposely don't mention rankings or the results of the rest of the field.

We will quietly check in the full election results (with anonymized ballots) into the community repo in the next few weeks. This will satisfy transparency requirements while being respectful to the other candidates.
