## What I'll do

Over my years on the project, I've seen that so much can be achieved when we
invest in delivering project-wide process improvements.

My single biggest goal is to **_reduce/remove friction in contributing to Kubernetes._**

We still have plenty of work to do here:

- Removing interrupts to allow SIG Chairs / Technical Leads to do more effective work
- Increasing our reviewers/approvers across component areas
- Continuing the SIG/WG Annual Report to identify improvements for all governance groups
- Nurturing efforts that support underrepresented / marginalized groups in technology
- Encouraging the growth of new project leaders, through both example and active mentorship
