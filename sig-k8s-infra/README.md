# K8s Infra Special Interest Group

SIG K8s Infra is interested in the successful migration of ownership and management of all Kubernetes project infrastructure from the google.com GCP Organization (or elsewhere) to the CNCF, such that the Kubernetes project is able to sustainably operate itself without direct assistance from external vendors or entities.
In other words, we seek to eradicate usage of the phrase "oh that's something that only an employee of Vendor X can do, we're blocked until they respond."

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the K8s Infra Special Interest Group.
