# sig-testing

The Kubernetes Testing SIG (sig-testing) is a working group within the Kubernetes contributor community interested in how we can most effectively test Kubernetes.  We're interested specifically in making it easier for the community to run tests and contribute test results, to ensure Kubernetes is stable across a variety of cluster configurations and cloud providers.

## video conference

We meet weekly on Tuesdays at 9:30am PDT (16:30 UTC) at [this zoom room](https://zoom.us/j/553910341)

## agenda

We use [a public google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z8MQpr_jTwhmjLMUaqQyBk1EYG_Y_3D4y4YdMJ7V1Kk) to track proposed agenda items, as well as take notes during meetings.

The agenda is open for comment.  Please contact the organizers listed below if you'd like to propose a topic.  Typically in the absence of anything formal we poll attendees for topics, and discuss tactical work.
