# 2025 Annual Report: SIG Testing

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

- Alpha/Beta Testing: TODO
  - [kubernetes-sig-testing@ announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-testing/c/llb2RssbO-E)
- Invariant Testing: TODO
  - [KEP-5468](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-testing/5468-invariant-testing)
  - [kubernetes-sig-testing@ announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-testing/c/UORczK2LRow)
- TestGrid UI: TODO
  - Thanks to contributors for continuing to develop this, and to SIG K8s Infra for setting up the in-progress UI at [testgrid.prow.k8s.io](https://testgrid.prow.k8s.io/)!

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?
   Yes! While we have some increased interest compared to last year for SIG Testing frameworks/tools, we still need dedicated maintainers for most areas, especially [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow).

3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2025 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?
