# This file is a series of lines, each of the form:
#     <type> <name>
#
# Type can be:
#    path - an exact path to a single file
#    file-name - an exact leaf filename, regardless of path
#    path-prefix - a prefix match on the file path
#    file-prefix - a prefix match of the leaf filename (no path)
#    paths-from-repo - read a file from the repo and load file paths
#
# For the community repo, there are no autogenerated files that should be skipped by tools and automation.
