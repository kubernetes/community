# Multicluster SIG

Covers multi-cluster Kubernetes use cases and tooling. This includes: application resiliency against availability zone outages; hybrid clouds; spanning of multiple could providers; application migration from private to public clouds (and vice versa); and other similar subjects. This SIG was formerly called sig-federation and focused on the Federation project, but expanded its charter to all multi-cluster concerns in August 2017.
