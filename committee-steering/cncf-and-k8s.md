# Relationship with CNCF

The Kubernetes project is a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) project. 

The Steering Committee is the designated top-level project leadership body which serves 
as the project's interface to the foundation (as opposed to all of the maintainers of all
repositories). The Kubernetes project is self-governing, reserves the right to resolve 
conflicts within its community, set its own governance policies, define its own scope, 
determine how and when official releases of Kubernetes are made and what they include, 
specify its own conformance criteria, maintain its own marketing functions 
(e.g., its blog and Twitter account), establish its own resource 
access policies, manage its own assets (including trademark enforcement boundaries), accept 
contributions of additional subprojects, and so on. The Kubernetes project expects the CNCF
to provide funds for essential assets and ongoing activities, requests for which must be 
approved by the Steering Committee, to provide legal and logistical assistance, and to provide 
other assistance within the bounds approved by the CNCF Governance Board and Technical Oversight
Committee upon request from the Steering Committee.

Current standing CNCF-funded expenditures include:
* Github, for private repos
* Reviewable.io, for enterprise edition
* Netlify.com, for documentation hosting
* Zack Corleissen, for documentation editing
* kubernetes.io, k8s.io domains
* K8s birthday party
