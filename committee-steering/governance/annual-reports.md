# Kubernetes Community Group Annual Reports

This document outlines the bootstrap process for an annual reporting and
communication structure for Special Interest Groups (SIGs), Working Groups (WGs)
, User Groups (UGs), and Committees
All policy updates will be in their respective [SIG], [WG], and [UG]
 governance docs as well as the general [governance] guidance.

## Goals
- Paint a complete project health picture for all of our community groups
- Create a feedback loop between Chairs, Tech Leads, Subproject Owners, WG and
UG Organizers, the community groups at large, and the Steering
Committee to move the project forward  
- Encourage dialogue about the wellbeing of the projects contributors and offer
suggested guidance and coaching
- Promote healthy, active, engaged community groups  
- Understand and have context before issues arise and celebrate wins where they  
should be highlighted  
- Help reshape project priorities at a high level

## Reporting Process  

Chairs and Organizers are responsible for compiling a yearly public report but
may be completed with the help of members of that group. Groups are encouraged
to make this an agenda item of topic to discuss together. Chairs and Organizers
ensure that reports are complete, accurate, and submitted to the Steering
Committee.

### 2021 and on:
1. Steering Committee liaison reaches out to group leads to kick off
2. Chairs/Organizers will:
  - share with their groups (see tips below) and begin to 
compile the doc due April 8th - final version
  - use these [questions]
  - submit a pull request with at least the template questions against the set 
  issue to the groups documentation in the community repo by March 8th
  - verify that Steering Liaison has reviewed
  - post a call for comments period with your groups mailing list and a complete 
  questionnaire; you can follow your charter communication period if you have
  one but no less than 72 hours 
  - if there are private matters to address with Steering before submitting the 
pull request, share a copy with your liaison and wait until comments are
addressed before submitting.
3. The March edition of the "Chairs, Tech Leads, and Organizers" meetings will 
be used as follow up for the community groups that have questions from/to 
Steering and a retrospective
4. The Steering Committee liaison will work directly with groups that have 
follow up items and update Steering during regular monthly meetings. The liaison
will also coordinate time with the Chairs (as a group). If you'd like to meet 
1:1 instead, please let your liaison know.
We'd like to hear about the following:  
  - goals you have for the group, your experience in the role so far - 
  challenges, wins, things you didn’t know before but wish you did, 
  - continue in the role or help finding a replacement if you've already asked 
  the group, 
  - any feedback you have for us as a body and how we can help Chairs and 
Organizers succeed and feel comfortable in your role. 

### 2020:
Due to playing catch up with 37 community groups, we will have a slightly
modified timeline bootstrap process this year and then will follow the process
outlined for 2021. Working Groups, due to their temporary nature, will be the 
only group to submit for 2020.   

1. Steering Committee will assign one member as a liaison to each community 
group for kick off, help, or guidance needed throughout the process during the 
first week of July
2. Working Group Organizers create one report and send it to/share it with 
steering-private@kubernetes.io for review; reports should take ~30 days to 
complete (work with your liaison on timeline)
3. Steering will schedule private meetings to follow up on anything denoted as
a private matter on the report; reports are not made public until all private
comments have been addressed
4. Once reviewed and follow ups are completed, the liaison will ask the 
organizer(s) of the group to submit a pull request to that groups documentation 
in the community repo
5. The Steering Committee liaison will work directly with groups that have 
follow up items and update Steering during regular monthly meetings. 

### Tips for Chairs and Working Group Organizers:      
- Work together with your groups roles and community members to complete;
suggestion: schedule a dedicated meeting or intentional agenda item to go over 
project health with the goal of compiling this report, delegate to subproject
owners or other community members
- All questions require a response. 
- End users and other members of the community will read these. Err on the side
of being more explicit than using our upstream shorthand or abbreviations. 
- If there are any private matters that you'd like to discuss as part of the
questions, share the document with us at steering-private@kubernetes.io before 
submitting the pull request. 
- The [questions] can be forked into whatever medium you wish to
collaborate with your community: gdocs, hackmd, etc - it will all land back into
a pull request at the end.

else?
