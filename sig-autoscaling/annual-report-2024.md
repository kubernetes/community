# 2024 Annual Report: SIG Autoscaling

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

<!--
   Some example items that might be worth highlighting:
   - Major KEP advancement
   - Important initiatives that aren't tracked via KEPs
   - Paying down significant tech debt
   - Governance and leadership changes
-->
 - Dynamic Reasource Allocation support

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?
 - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler - see [this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128948)



3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2024 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?
