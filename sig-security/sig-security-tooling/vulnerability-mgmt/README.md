# Vulnerability Management

Covers Kubernetes wide vulnerability management process, policies and workflows
that tackle *known* vulnerabilities in Kubernetes artifacts that can be found
via automation

## Goals

1. Identify known vulnerabilities in Kubernetes artifacts by scanning them
   periodically
2. Leverage the existing triage and resolution process (i.e. Github issues, PRs)
   to document and resolve any vulnerabilities that impact Kubernetes
3. Create community driven awareness and documentation around known CVEs in
   Kubernetes related artifacts

### Vulnerability Triage and Resolution Process

Leverage community driven triage and impact assessment to resolve known
vulnerabilities in Kubernetes artifacts. More details can be
found [here](process-for-vulnerability-triage-and-resolution.md)

### Build Time Dependencies

A tool agnostic periodic scanning of build time dependencies
(typically dependencies found in `go.mod` file) of Kubernetes. More details can
be found [here](build-time-dependencies.md)

This track is a partnership between SIG
Architecture's [Code Organization](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture#code-organization)
sub-project and SIG Security's Tooling sub-project

### Container Images

Automating triage and resolution of vulnerabilities as it relates to container
images in Kubernetes Github Org. This effort is beginning to take form and is being tracked in
[Issue #5920](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5920)

This track is a partnership
between [SIG Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release)
and SIG Security's Tooling sub-project

**Note**: Artifacts here refer to code, images and binaries

## Non-Goals

1. **Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities**: This will continue to be the
   responsibility
   of [Security Response Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/committee-product-security/README.md)
2. **Runtime dependencies**: Triaging of vulnerabilities found in components
   that are runtime dependencies for an on-premises or *-as-a-service*
   Kubernetes deployment. Examples include but are not limited to container
   runtimes, container registries, Node OS
3. **Resolving license violations**: Allowed third party license policy can be
   found [here](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#approved-licenses-for-allowlist)
