# 2025 Annual Report: SIG Cloud Provider

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

* [KEP-5237 watch-based route conntroller reconciliation using informers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5237)
* [Kubernetes Resource Orchestrator (KRO)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kro/) was accepted by the SIG as an official subproject.
* [Announcing the deprecation of Cloud Provider Equinix Metal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-equinix-metal/issues/636) as the service is being retired.

<!--
   Some example items that might be worth highlighting:
   - Major KEP advancement
   - Important initiatives that aren't tracked via KEPs
   - Paying down significant tech debt
   - Governance and leadership changes
-->

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?


3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2025 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?
