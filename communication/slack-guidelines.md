# SLACK GUIDELINES

Slack is the main communication platform for Kubernetes outside of our mailing lists. It’s important that conversation stays on topic in each channel, and that everyone abides by the Code of Conduct. We have over 30,000 members who should all expect to have a positive experience.

Chat is searchable and public. Do not make comments that you would not say on a video recording or in another public space. Please be courteous to others.

`@here` and `@channel` should be used rarely. Members will receive notifications from these commands and we are a global project - please be kind. Note: `@all` is only to be used by admins.

## CODE OF CONDUCT
Kubernetes adheres to Cloud Native Compute Foundation's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) throughout the project, and includes all communication mediums.

## ADMINS
(by Slack ID and timezone)
* caniszczyk - CT
* ihor - CET
* jdumars - ET
* jorge - CT
* paris - PT

Slack Admins should make sure to mention this in the “What I do” section of their Slack profile, as well as for which time zone.

To connect: please reach out in the #slack-admins channel, mention one of us in the specific channel where you have a question, or DM (Direct Message) one of us privately.

### ADMIN EXPECTATIONS AND GUIDELINES
* Adhere to Code of Conduct
* Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by making members inactive
* Moderating and fostering a safe environment for conversations
* Bring Code of Conduct issues to the Steering Committee
* Create relevant channels and list Code of Conduct in new channel welcome message
* Help troubleshoot Slack issues
* Review bot, token, and webhook requests
* Be helpful!

## CREATING CHANNELS
Please reach out to the #slack-admins group with your request to create a new channel.

Channels are dedicated to [SIGs, WGs](/sig-list.md), sub-projects, community topics, and related Kubernetes programs/projects.  
Channels are not:
* company specific; cloud providers are ok with product names as the channel. Discourse will be about Kubernetes-related topics and not proprietary information of the provider.
* private unless there is an exception: code of conduct matters, mentoring, security/vulnerabilities, or steering committee.  

Typical naming conventions:
#kubernetes-foo #sig-foo #meetup-foo #location-users #projectname

All channels need a documented purpose. Use this space to welcome the targeted community: promote your meetings, post agendas, etc.

We may make special accommodations where necessary.

## ESCALATING and/or REPORTING A PROBLEM
Join the #slack-admins channel or contact one of the admins in the closest timezone via DM directly and describe the situation. If the issue can be documented, please take a screenshot to include in your message.

What if you have a problem with an admin?
Send a DM to another listed Admin and describe the situation OR
If it’s a code of conduct issue, please send an email to steering-private@kubernetes.io and describe the situation

## BOTS, TOKENS, WEBHOOKS, OH MY

Bots, tokens, and webhooks are reviewed on a case-by-case basis with most requests being rejected due to security, privacy, and usability concerns.. Bots and the like tend to make a lot of noise in channels. Our Slack instance has over 30,000 people and we want everyone to have a great experience. Please join #Slack-admins and have a discussion about your request before requesting the access. GitHub workflow alerts into certain channels and requests from CNCF are typically OK.

## ADMIN MODERATION

Be mindful of how you handle communication during stressful interactions.  Administrators act as direct representatives of the community, and need to maintain a very high level of professionalism at all times. If you feel too involved in the situation to maintain impartiality or professionalism, that’s a great time to enlist the help of another admin.

Try to take any situations that involve upset or angry members to DM or video chat. Please document these interactions for other Slack admins to review.

Content will be automatically removed if it violates code of conduct or is a sales pitch. Admins will take a screenshot of such behavior in order to document the situation.  The community takes such violations extremely seriously, and they will be handled swiftly.

## INACTIVATING ACCOUNTS

For reasons listed below, admins may inactivate individual Slack accounts. Due to Slack’s framework, it does not allow for an account to be banned or suspended in the traditional sense. [Visit Slack’s policy on this.](https://get.Slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204475027-Deactivate-a-member-s-account)

* Spreading spam content in DMs and/or channels
* Not adhering to the code of conduct set forth in DMs and/or channels
* Overtly selling products, related or unrelated to Kubernetes

## SPECIFIC CHANNEL RULES

In the case that certain channels have rules or guidelines, they will be listed in the purpose or pinned docs of that channel.

#kubernetes-dev = questions and discourse around upstream contributions and development to kubernetes
#kubernetes-careers = job openings for positions working with/on/around Kubernetes. Postings should include contact details.

## DM (Direct Message) Conversations

Please do not engage in proprietary company specific conversations in the Kubernetes Slack instance. This is meant for conversations around related Kubernetes open source topics and community. Proprietary conversations should occur in your company Slack and/or communication platforms.  As with all communication, please be mindful of appropriateness, professionalism, and applicability to the Kubernetes community.
