# Kubernetes Upstream Marketing Contributor Communications Team Charter

## Summary

The mission of the Kubernetes Upstream Marketing Contributor Communications team (Contributor Comms for short) is to elevate the hard work being done throughout the Kubernetes community by its contributors. Promoting the work and helping fill the needs of the Kubernetes community is the driving force behind the Contributor Comms team. The goal of this work is to improve the overall sustainability of the project by giving or elevating information to contributors so they stay well informed.

## Ethos/Vision

This group's work is in support of the upstream Kubernetes community only (the open source project). As such it will adhere to the [Kubernetes Community Values](/values.md#kubernetes-community-values). The core value we feel strongest about is [Community over product or company](/values.md#community-over-product-or-company). The makeup of this team will be from all walks of life including vendors. The work of the Kubernetes community should always be prioritized over vendor created works. Contributor Comms team members are expected to act in the interest of the community and not their employers.

## Goals

The goal of the Contributor Comms team is to be of service to the community by being leaders in contributor storytelling. It will act to facilitate conversations across the Kubernetes community and share compelling stories about contributors. It will also act as a voice of the community to broaden the reach and effectiveness of community communications. Facilitating those communications is a critical function of this team.

## Out of Scope

This team operates independently from Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) operations. The Team works with CNCF as needed but it exists within the Kubernetes governance model and is not a part or extension of CNCF Marketing. As such, this is not the team to reach out to about official CNCF Events and/or KubeCon. #kubecon on slack can be a helpful resource there. This team can assist in some ways with other CNCF projects but, the first priority of the team is Kubernetes.

## Governance

Leadership is divided up between [Marketing Council] team members. This group of leaders divide up the core responsibilities of the team and look to further optimize the experience of both code and non-code contributors.

### Roles

Roles are divided up between Marketing Council members and other members, notably Storytellers. Marketing Council members are scoped to have at least one shadow. All leads should actively recruit shadows for the entire team.

### Decision Making

Decisions affecting all of Contributor Comms are made primarily led by the program lead as defined in the [Marketing Council]. They come to decision by lazy consensus with the goal of everyone getting a say, but they are responsible for making the decision. If other council members do not agree with one or more decisions made on behalf of the team, this should be raised to the advisors as well as the SIG Contributor Experience leads to facilitate a resolution.

Other council leads have the responsibility and autonomy to decide what is right for their portion of the council's division of work. The same escalation path can be used in case of disagreement that cannot be resolved by internal discussion.

### Off-Ramp

Things change, priorities get optimized, life happens. Having an easy on and off ramp is important to this team. If a lead needs to take an extended absence or leave the team, a shadow would be offered the lead position prior to seeking a lead elsewhere. Therefore moving from shadow to lead and vice versa should be made as simply as possible by continued communications from this team about its members, roles, successes, and failures.

In the case where no shadow is available, other Marketing Council team members have the responsibility to cover the role. Concerns for time or ability to cover work can be escalated to advisors and SIG Contributor Experience leads as necessary.
