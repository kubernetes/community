# 2025 Annual Report: WG AI Integration

## Current initiatives and Project Health


1. What work did the WG do this year that should be highlighted?

As a newly formed WG, in 2025 we mostly discussed existing or actively developed products (which can be considered components of AI/ML control planes)
that target Kubernetes and how this WG can help natively integrate them into Kubernetes.

Some of the products we discussed;

* kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox
* modelcontextprotocol/registry
* stacklok/toolhive
* agentgateway/agentgateway

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

Not currently
