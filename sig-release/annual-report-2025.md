- Ongoing enhancements to release engineering processes and automation

**Leadership Continuity:**
- Stable leadership with chairs Jeremy Rickard ([@jeremyrickard](https://github.com/jeremyrickard)), Stephen Augustus ([@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus)), and Sascha Grunert ([@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

None at this time. All subprojects have adequate OWNERS coverage.

3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2025 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?

**[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025](https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/) (London, April 1-4):**

4. KEP work in 2025 (v1.33, v1.34, v1.35):

No KEPs were directly owned by SIG Release in the 2025 release cycles. SIG Release continues to focus on release process improvements, tooling enhancements, and infrastructure work that enables the broader Kubernetes community rather than feature development tracked via KEPs.
