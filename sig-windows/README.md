## Getting Started

If you're looking for information on building and running containers on Windows, you can get started at http://aka.ms/windowscontainers.

Kubernetes 1.14 includes stable support for Windows Server containers and has up-to-date [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/) .

Additional information and guides are available in the [KEPs for SIG-Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-windows)

## Discuss
Join us on [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-windows) or the [Kubernetes Community Forums](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/c/general-discussions/windows) to chat about Windows containers on Kubernetes.

## Contributing

To get yourself familiar with contributing, please read the [Kubernetes Contributor Guide](../contributors/guide/README.md) and the [SIG-Windows Contributor guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

We're currently using a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/8) in the weekly SIG-Windows meeting to track items with active progress for each release. That's a great place to start to get the most up-to-date status, then feel free to join us on the Slack channel anytime with questions.

As always, you can also find the active list of open issues and proposals [Open Code Issues and PRs for SIG/Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels/sig%2Fwindows) on GitHub.
