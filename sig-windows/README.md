## Getting Started

If you're looking for information on building and running containers on Windows, you can get started at http://aka.ms/windowscontainers .

Kubernetes 1.9 includes beta support for Windows Server containers and has an up-to-date [Getting Started Guide for Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/windows/) .

Some additional guides are available, but may refer to older releases:

* Using host gateway networking: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/getting-started-kubernetes-windows 
* Using OVN as demonstrated at Google Cloud Next '17: https://github.com/apprenda/kubernetes-ovn-heterogeneous-cluster
