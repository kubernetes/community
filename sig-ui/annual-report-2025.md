# 2025 Annual Report: SIG UI

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

* Moved the Headlamp project under the SIG UI.
* Kubernetes Dashboard was in maintenance mode, having had only dependency
  update PRs merged.
* joaquimrocha joined as a SIG UI lead.
* After joining the SIG UI (April 2025), Headlamp had 10 blog posts, 10
  releases, and 9 community calls.

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

  In later December the SIG UI leaders decided to discontinue Kubernetes Dashboard,
  resulting in the archiving of the project in early 2026.

3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2025 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?

* Headlamp participated in the LFX Mentorhip with 7 projects, had 9 community
  calls.
* Headlamp participated actively in KubeCon Europe (London) with a talk, a
  Contribfest session, and a part-time kiosk. And participted in KubeCon NA
  (Atlanta) with a Contribfest session, a talk, and a full-time kiosk. There
  were other talks given about Headlamp in the Microsoft booth, and one talk at
  FluxCon.
