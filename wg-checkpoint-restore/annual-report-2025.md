# 2025 Annual Report: WG Checkpoint Restore

## Current initiatives and Project Health


1. What work did the WG do this year that should be highlighted?

In 2025, the working group was established and held its first meeting in
December. The working group set up all the usual infrastructure like mailing
list, calendar, Slack channel, and Zoom meeting.

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

As the working group just started its work, no help is needed so far.
