## Contributing to Individual SIGs

Each SIG may or may not have it's own policies for editing their section of this repository.

Edits in SIG sub-directories should follow any additional guidelines described
by the respective SIG leads in the sub-directory's `CONTRIBUTING` file
(e.g. [sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING](sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Attending a [SIG meeting](/sig-list.md) or posting on their mailing list might be prudent if you want to make extensive contributions.
